	"Description": "In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:<br/>• You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.<br/>• When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.<br/>• You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.<br/> If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.<br/> Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconcious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.<br/> Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.",
